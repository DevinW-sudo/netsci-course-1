\section{Course Description}

Networks provide a unifying framework to study complex systems across
biological, social, and information systems. This course focuses on the
fundamentals and key applications of network science, addressing the following
questions: why do networks matter? What are the fundamental frameworks and
theories to understand the structure and dynamics of networks?  How has network
framework been applied to other fields? What are the frontiers of the research?

\section{Course Objectives}

By the end of the course, you will be able to both mathematically and
conceptually explain the key concepts and findings of network science. You will
be able to identify, construct, visualize, and analyze networks by choosing and
applying appropriate methods and algorithms.   

\section{Prerequisites}
\label{sec:Prerequisites}

The course will require good foundation of mathematics and programming,
although there is no formal prerequisite. Key reprequisites are: probability,
statistics, linear algebra, data structures, and algorithms. Python is used as
the main programming language and it will be helpful to be proficient in
Python. Contact the instructor if you are uncertain about your background.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

Students are required to read assigned readings, watch the lectures, complete
quizzes and assignments, and engage in online discussions. In addition, each
student will finish a (replication) project. 

\section{Books and key materials}

We will closely follow the
\href{http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/}{Network Science} by Albert-Lásló
Barabási. The following books can be helpful:

\subsection{Python and data analysis}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \href{http://www.diveintopython3.net/index.html}{Dive Into Python} by Mark Pilgrim (available online): a good Python book. 

\item \href{http://www.learnpython.org}{Learnpython.org}: A web-based interactive tutorial. 

\item \href{http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/html/}{An introduction to statistics} (with Python) by Thomas Haslwanter (available online): this book uses Python to explain basic statistics. It also contains a succinct tutorial for Python and data visualization using Python. 

\item \href{http://ipython.rossant.net}{Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization} by  Cyrille Rossant: Introduction to IPython as well as lots of advanced analysis 


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Network Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \href{https://www.amazon.com/Networks-Introduction-Mark-Newman/dp/0199206651}{Networks: An Introduction} by Mark Newman. 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Policies}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{Disabilities.} Every attempt will be made to accommodate qualified
students with disabilities (e.g. mental health, learning, chronic health,
physical, hearing, vision, neurological, etc.). You must have established your
eligibility for support services through Disability Services for Students. Note
that services are confidential, may take time to put into place, and are not
retroactive.  Captions and alternate media for print materials may take three
or more weeks to get produced. Please contact Disability Services for Students
at \url{http://disabilityservices.indiana.edu} or 812-855-7578 as soon as
possible if accommodations are needed. The office is located on the third
floor, west tower, of the Wells Library (Room W302). Walk-ins are welcome 8 AM
to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. You can also locate a variety of campus
resources for students and visitors who need assistance at
\url{http://www.iu.edu/~ada/index.shtml}. 

\item \emph{Sexual misconduct and Title IX.} As your instructor, one of my
responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students.
Title IX and IU's Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any
form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and
domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone
who has, the University can help. If you are seeking help and would like to
speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

\begin{enumerate}
    
\item The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
\item Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
\item IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

\end{enumerate}

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require
me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual
misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU's Title IX
Coordinator. In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that
appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available. Protecting
student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with
those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist. I
encourage you to visit \emph{stopsexualviolence.iu.edu} to learn more. 

\item \emph{Be honest.} Your assignments and papers should be your own work.
First, if you find useful resources for your assignments, share them and cite
them. If your friends helped you, acknolwedge them. Second, feel free to
discuss both online and offline, but you should not show your code (papers) nor
see other's. Any cases of academic misconduct (cheating, fabrication,
plagiarism, etc) will be immediately reported to the School and the Dean of
Students, following the standard procedure. Cheating is not cool. 

\item \emph{You have the responsibility of backing up all your data and code}.
Always use at least Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Ideally, learn version
control systems and use \url{https://github.iu.edu} or
\url{https://github.com}. Loss of data, code, or papers due to various reasons
(e.g. malfunction of your laptop) is not an acceptable excuse for delayed or
missing submission. 

\item If you have any mental health issues, don't hesistate to contact
\href{http://jhealthcenter.indiana.edu/counseling/index.shtml}{IU's Counseling
and Psychological Services}. 


\end{enumerate}
